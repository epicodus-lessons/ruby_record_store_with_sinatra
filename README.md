# Ruby Record Store

This project introduces the backend logic and tests needed to build routing for the record store project.

The views folder, `app.rb`, and our integration tests are all empty for now. To complete this project, work through the LearnHowToProgram.com lessons in [Routing with Ruby](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby-and-rails/routing-with-ruby) starting with the lesson [Embedded Ruby](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby-and-rails/routing-with-ruby/embedded-ruby).
